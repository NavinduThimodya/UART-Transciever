# UART-Transciever

Aim of this project is to creat an UART transceiver: to be implemented on two **_Terasic DE10-Nano_** FPGA Development Kits. This project was done in partial fulfilment of the _EN2111 Electronic Circuits Design_ of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
The UART transciever has a 115000 MHz of a baud rate
